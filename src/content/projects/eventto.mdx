# eventto.ca

Take a look at my new project where you can see events happening around Toronto.

I got the idea for this project when i learned about the **[Toronto City database](https://open.toronto.ca/, "City of Toronto Open Data Portal")**.
This website has a wealth of information in the form of datasets tracking all kinds of information in varying formats and time periods. Each dataset are assigned
scores that indicate the quality of the dataset as well. My idea was to pick a dataset that provdies realtime information regardless of the quality of the data.
The one that stood out to me was the **[Festivals and Events dataset](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/festivals-events/, "Festivals and Events dataset link")**.

The dataset not only contained all kinds of relevant event related information like the name, description, cost, reservation, date info etc... It also included geographic information
in including latitudes, longitudes, type of event (whether it was inside a building (indicated by a marker type) or over a large area (indicated by a polygon type)). This was really
cool and I thought I could maybe display this information on a map. On the downside, the dataset had some problems like:
- Lack of robust documentation.
- Missing and incoherent/inconsistent data.

Regardless, I learned to consider for false positives and missing information. 

My initial idea was to make a simple frontend app and fetch the data, however, I wanted to refresh my memory SQL memory so I opted to
build out an api server as backend. My choice of backend was pretty simple as I had some constraints which helped narrow down my choices. I wanted a **simple server**
with minimal config, my choice of language was **Python** and I wanted **sql database** to store event information. Based on these constraints, **Flask** was an easy choice.

With the choice made, I immediately began working on the project. I made a few blueprints that matches the feature set like:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS event;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS date;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS weeklyDate;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS location;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cost;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS image;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reservation;
```

Based on these tables, I made a mapping of api endpoints that served each table of information. I also had a geojson endpoint one which incoded location based info based on the
**[**GeoJSON standard**](https://geojson.org/ "GeoJSON standard link")**

After setting up some basic stuff. I moved onto the frontend and I again opted for something simple and since I already knew react, I set up a simple react vite project with typescript.
Now I mentioned geoJSON above. Geojson is the standard used to display map related information. So I extract the latitude longitude information along with the type
(I only extracted the marker types as I dont intend to make the map too cluttered) and appended properties required by the frontend (like eventId, name etc...)

Here is a pic of the geojson endpoint and the response as an example.

Now i had to think of how to display the map information. To keep trend going, opting for the simple solution lead me to picking **[**Mapbox**](https://www.mapbox.com/ "Mapbox website link")**.
Mapbox was pretty easy to work with and they had pretty good documentation for me to get started with. With the geojson data ready, all I had to do was fetch them and loop over the events and display them.

Heres an image one all the events are fully loaded:

I added popups which enabled users to view information by clicking on one of the event bubbles. A popup will appear displaying key information.
![eventto website event popup](../images/eventto/popup.png "eventto website event popup")

I also decided to make an event page (pretty rushed) to display any other information about the event although the event website usually fit the bill here.
(Listed as part of the popup if available)

To deploy, I had a couple of choices, I wanted to use aws services just so that I can learn about how aws works. I came across **[AWS lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/ "AWS lightsail website link")**
which was a vps service. Since i was already familiar with configuring servers (my raspberry pi), I decided to opt for the lightsail option. They also provided free 90 days of use which helped. After loading an instance
I went ahead and also bought eventto.ca domain. With cloudflare experience already under my belt, i decided to transfer the domain to cloudflare as well. After obtaining the static ip I registered it as a dns record for eventto.ca
and boom I am ready to set everything up.

I initially had plans to cet up CI/CD pipeline to build and move files to my vps and serve etc... But to keep up with the trend, I opted to host my frontend using Cloudflare workers. This makes it remarkably easy to manage
frontend as I dont really have to do anything else, cloudflare carries, thank you cloudflare! As for my flask api server, I moved it to my vps which was built based on the Nginx image managed by bitnami.
For moving my server files over, all I had to do was get the ssh credentials along with the private key which aws provided and I used FileZilla as per their recommendation (I didnt have any other SFTP application anyways).
After moving my server files, the next step was to configure things like CORS and proxy pass so nginx knows when to proxy the requests. Heres the final nginx config i ended up with:

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name api.eventto.ca;

    ssl_certificate /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/certificates/eventto.ca.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/certificates/eventto.ca.key;

    # Security headers
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    # add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' '$http_origin' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Content-Type, Authorization' always;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers' 'Content-Type' always;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix /;

        # Timeout configurations
        proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
        proxy_send_timeout 60s;
        proxy_read_timeout 60s;
        send_timeout 60s;
    }

    # Error pages
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /opt/bitnami/nginx/html;
    }
}
```

The api is accessible at **[https://api.eventto.ca](https://api.eventto.ca "api link")** **Note:** the root url doesnt display anything and you need to know the specific endpoints.
