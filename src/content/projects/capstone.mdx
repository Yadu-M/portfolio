# Automated Parking Management System
We basically designed as the title says an Automated Parking Management System. The objective was to showcase by utilizing IoT devices
with wireless sensing and reporting capabilities along with a central server/processor and intelligent decision making, an efficient
system is possible.

## Overview
We designed an intelligent and self sufficient parking management system using IoT technologies. Our System comprised of
multiple components including IoT hardware to fullfill tasks such as:
- **Weight Sensors** : Detected the presence of vehicles during the parking state. Crucial role
played to accurately track a parking spot state.
- **Servo Motors** : Controlled the gate based on the entrance state determined by the entrance
sub system.
- **Led Modules** : Helped to visually indicate the state of a specific parking spot. Ex. red = occupied, green = !occupied.
- **ESPCAM** : Detected QR-Codes from User Web App to authenticate and authorize the User to enter the parking lot.
- **ESP32** : Served as the central Unit to bridge gaps between other sub systems including the Web App. It connected 
all the above mentioned components and it set the main logic for the system.

### Design Breakdown

|     | Hardware  |  Software | 
| --  | :-: | :-: |
| **User Authentication** | ESP-CAM detects for QR-Codes and decodes them. Updates RTDB after successful verification.  | Web App generates a unique QR-Code encoded with an encrypted code. |
| **Entrance** | Servo motor open/close the game gate depending on the RTDB state value. | ESP32 listens for RTDB state change pushed after QR-Code verification. Sends command to Servo to update in real-time. |
| **Parking Spot** | Each HDX711 with load cell is assigned a unique ID. When change is detected, sends signal to ESP32. | ESP32 listens signal to then update the Database value corresponding to the parking spot and the user. |
| **Analytics** | NA | Patterns including user occurance, parking spot traffic are noted and stored as part of conducting analysis. |
